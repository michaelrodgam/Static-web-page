				<p>I am a junior web developer, a psychologist, a gamer, and also a software engineering student from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica" target="_blank" class="link">Costa Rica</a>.
			This is simple static web page. I'm doing this just to show you my skills as a front-end developer, but I don't really know what to write here. Well, this is an article about videogames, art and web pages. There is a lot to talk, you know. Please take a look!</p>

				<p>Well, if you do not know, it's really easy, actually. You need to learn how to do it, right? 
			Just that, simple enough. Let me give you an advice: in order to make a web page you need to learn: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>

					<p>A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a 
						two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen, virtual reality headset or monitor/TV set. 
						Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly important part of the entertainment industry, and whether 
						they are also a form of art is a matter of dispute. The electronic systems used to play video games are called 
						platforms. Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. 
						Specialized platforms such as arcade games, which present the game in a large, typically coin-operated chassis, 
						were common in the 1980s in video arcades, but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms became 
						available. These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles, as well as general-purpose computers like a 
						laptop, desktop or handheld computing devices. The input device used for games, the game controller, varies across 
						platforms. Common controllers include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices,
						 or even a person's body, using a Kinect sensor. Players view the game on a display device such as a television or computer 
						 monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and voice
						  actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating 
						  effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets. <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">(wikipedia.)</a></p>
